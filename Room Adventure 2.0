#Game Story: You are on a search for grandpa's treasure.
#Look at the apron and read the clue inside instructing you to go 
#to the library.
#Reading the book on the bookshelf gives a clue about where the
#treasure in the game is, as well as a warning about the danger.
#The golden statue points downwards for another clue about where the
#treasure lies in the house.
#Next to the door in the basement is a locked box, which you must
#use the key picked up from the table to open.
#Once you open the box, you discover the treasure inside, and the
#game ends.
#Instructions to win: Look apron, look paper, take paper, read paper, look bookshelf,
#take book, read book, go north, go east, look statue, go south,
#look dresser, use key, enter "yes"
